# Trump's Approval Margins

Let us first load the data and clean it

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.

library(lubridate)

approval_polllist$modeldate <- mdy(approval_polllist$modeldate)
approval_polllist$startdate <- mdy(approval_polllist$startdate)
approval_polllist$enddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)
approval_polllist$createddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$createddate)

```

## Create a plot

Now lets lot the net approval for Donald Trump in the last 4 years

```{r, cache=TRUE}
#Adding net approval
president_approval <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(net_approval = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove)

#Calculating statistics
net_approval_weekly <- president_approval %>%
  filter (subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  group_by (week_number = isoweek(enddate),
            year=year(enddate)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_app = mean(net_approval,
                            na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_app = sd(net_approval,
                        na.rm = TRUE),
            count_app = n(),
            se_app = sd_app / sqrt(count_app),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_app-1) ,
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_app,
            app_low = mean_app - margin_of_error,
            app_high = mean_app + margin_of_error) %>%
  filter(count_app>1)

#Plotting

## Compare Confidence Intervals

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#Filtering for week 15 year 2020 in the table
net_approval_week15 <- net_approval_weekly %>%
  filter(week_number == 15, year == 2020)

net_approval_week15

#Filtering for week 34 year 2020 in the table
net_approval_week34 <- net_approval_weekly %>%
  filter(week_number == 34, year == 2020)

net_approval_week34

```

> Looking at the graph, the confidence interval of the later week (week 34) is larger. There might be two reasons for this development, standard deviation and sample size. Variability might be increased and/ or the sample size might be reduced. Checking the table, we are able to identify that standard deviation indeed increased and sample size indeed decreased.
