# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

Scenario: A sample of 50 employees (24 men, 26 women) at Omega Group Plc showed a 8,700 difference in average salary for men compared to women. 

We are going to investigate whether this marked difference is indeed significant and whether there is an observable factor (such as experience) that could explain the difference.

## Loading the data

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
gender_dataframe <- mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval
gender_dataframe2 <- gender_dataframe %>%
  mutate(t_crit =qt(0.975,n-1),
         SE = sd/sqrt(n),
         ME = t_crit*SE,
         lower = mean - ME,
         upper = mean + ME)
select(gender_dataframe2,-min, -Q1, -median, -Q3, -max, -missing)
```

## Comment
We can conclude that based on the dataset above, there is a significant difference between the salaries paid to men and women. We can be 95% certain of this because, at this significance level, the two different confidence intervals do not overlap. Therefore it is very unlikely that the difference in salary averages paid to men and women occured by coincidence.

Next, we will conduct a hypothesis test to assess whether our null hypothesis, that salary averages of men and women are not significantly different, is accepted or rejected.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data=omega)
```


```{r, hypothesis_testing_boostrap}
# hypothesis testing using infer package, firstly creating a bootstrap simulation
set.seed(1234)
salarygenderbootstrap <- omega %>%
  # Specifying variable of interest:
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  # Set our null hypothesis as the two variables are independent:
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>%
  # Creating a bootstrap simulation
  generate( reps = 1000,
            type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("male","female"))
#salarygenderbootstrap

#Percentile method with infer package
cipercentile <- salarygenderbootstrap %>%
get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile")
cipercentile

# Visualising bootstrap
salarygenderbootstrap %>%
  visualise() +
  geom_linerange(aes(gender_dataframe2[2,7]-gender_dataframe2[1,7],
                     ymin=0,
                     ymax=Inf),
                 size=2,
                 color="red")+
                   annotate("text",x=6000,y=150,label=paste("Observation: $",round(gender_dataframe2[2,7]-gender_dataframe2[1,7],2)))+
  
  # Shading the confidence interval on our bootstrap simulation
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = cipercentile,colour="green",fill="lightblue")+
  
theme_clean()+
scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format())+
  labs(x="Salary Gap",
       y="Count",
       title="Omega's Gender Pay Gap",
       subtitle="Bootstrap simulation of gender pay gap",
       caption="Source: Omega Group plc Salary Data") +NULL

# Finding the p-value, i.e. the probability of observing this sample mean by pure coincidence
salarygenderbootstrap %>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = gender_dataframe2[2,7]-gender_dataframe2[1,7],direction="both")
```

0.2% chance that this is a coincidence, reject the null hypothesis.  However, we cannot affirm that this significant salary difference is due to discrimination as there may be some other factors involved. Finding out the true causes of the salary gap requires further analyses.


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

The gender pay gap is definitely clear, but we now need to find out why. We learn that on average, men in the sample have 21 years of experience whereas women have 7 years. Could the level of experience be a strong driver of salary?

```{r, experience_summarystats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
gender_dataframe4 <- favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)
gender_dataframe4
```

```{r, experience_ttest}
# Conducting a t test for the relationship between gender and experience 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)
```

Our p value is virtually zero, and our 95% confidence interval does not include a difference of zero between the two means. Therefore, there is a significant difference between the experience between men and women.

```{r, experience_stats}
set.seed(5678)
gender_experience <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps=1000,
           type="permute") %>%
  
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("male","female"))

# Finding the 95% confidence interval using percentile method
cigenderexperience <- gender_experience %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type="percentile")
cigenderexperience

# Visualising bootstrap
gender_experience %>%
  visualise() +
  geom_linerange(aes(gender_dataframe4[2,7]- gender_dataframe4[1,7],
                     ymin=0,
                     ymax=Inf),
                 size=2,
                 color="red")+
                   annotate("text",x=9,y=150,label=paste("Observation: ",round(gender_dataframe4[2,7]-gender_dataframe4[1,7],2)))+
  
  # Highlighting the confidence interval on our visualised bootstrap simulation
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = cigenderexperience, colour = "green",fill="lightblue") +
  
theme_clean()+
  labs(x="Experience Gap",
       y="Count",
       title="Title 1",
       subtitle="Bootstrap simulation of gender pay gap",
       caption="Source: Omega Group plc Salary Data") +NULL

gender_experience %>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = gender_dataframe4[2,7]-gender_dataframe4[1,7],direction="both")
```

All tests above support the rejection of the null hypothesis - a significant difference between the the experience of men and women can be confirmed. This is not contradictory with our previous results. However, it supports the thesis, that salary differences are not necessarily due to gender discrimination, but factors like experience might also have an impact.

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

We will now investigate whether there is any significant relationship between experience and salary in order to determine whether there is a clear reason explaining Omega's gender pay gap.


```{r, salary_exp_cor}
#Calculating correlation
cor(omega$experience, omega$salary)
#Correlation is 0.803, strong and positive
```

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
#Plotting a scatterplot

ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience,
                 y=salary,alpha=0.3))+
  geom_point(aes(colour = gender),size=3)+
  geom_smooth(aes(x=experience,y=salary),
              method=lm,
              se=FALSE,
              colour="blue")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format())+
  theme_calc() +
  labs(title = "Strong relationship between experience and salary",
       x="Experience (years)",
       y="Salary",
       caption = "Source: Omega Group plc: Pay Discrimination")

```

## Check correlations between the data

Using `GGally:ggpairs()` to efficiently observe relationships between all the variables in our dataset.

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> We can infer a strong positive relationship between salary and experience. Moreover, we can see that among the top 10 employees ranked by experience, only 1 is female. Conversely, all 6 employees with 0 years of experience are female. Therefore, we can have reasonable confidence in deducing that Omega's gender pay gap is not necessarily discriminatory, but driven by very pronounced differences in experience which is a strong predictor of salary.
