Please express all figures in billions (divide values by <code>1e9</code>, or <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span>), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany is a mature economy and we do not observe significant movements in their GDP components. One exception could possibly be Net Exports which has increased sharply around the 2000s which coincides with Euro adoption allowing Germany to trade more easily.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>India, as an emerging economy, has a much more volatile GDP trend. We see a significant drop in consumption and a corresponding increase in investment in the 2000s. It could be caused by the start of the offshoring trend where firms realised it is cheaper for them to outsource services to India, hence the increase in investment. It is possible that this has caused the relative contribution of household consumption to decrease.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the US we can see a steady growth of household expenditure component and a corresponding drop of the investment component. Around the financial crisis of 2008 we can see a spike in government spending and a drop in consumption with a more significant decrease in investment. This is a result of the banking crisis.</p>
