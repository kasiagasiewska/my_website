```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed

# Exploring links between GDP, life expectancy, HIV prevalence, mortality and fertility and others

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")

library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- read_csv(here::here("data","worldbank_data.csv"))

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  read.csv(here::here("data","countries.csv"))

```

Working with the following three data frames:

* hiv
* life_expectancy
* worldbank_data

As a first step, we need to tidy the data of hiv and life_expectancy.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
#glimpse(hiv)
#glimpse(life_expectancy)
#glimpse(worldbank_data)
```
```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(countrycode)

#tidy the data fo hiv and life_expectancy
hiv_tidy <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("1979":"2011"),
               names_to = "date" , 
               values_to = "hiv_prevalence", 
               values_drop_na= FALSE)


life_expectancy_tidy <- life_expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("1800":"2100"),
   names_to = "date" , 
   values_to = "life_expectancy", 
   values_drop_na= FALSE)

#Preparation for left join 
life_expectancy_tidy$date <- as.double(life_expectancy_tidy$date)
hiv_tidy$date <- as.double(hiv_tidy$date)

#Left join the data frames
three_combined <- left_join(worldbank_data,life_expectancy_tidy) %>%
  left_join(.,hiv_tidy) %>%
   mutate(region= countrycode(sourcevar = country, origin = "country.name",destination = "region"))

three_combined


```

## Relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#Plotting two graphs, one for all countries, one focusing on the different regions
ggplot(data = three_combined, 
       aes(x = hiv_prevalence, 
           y= life_expectancy )) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title="Negative correlation between HIV prevalence and life expectancy",
       subtitle="HIV prevalence and life expectancy",
       x="HIV prevalence",
       y="Life expectancy") + 
  theme_classic()

ggplot(data = three_combined, 
       aes(x = hiv_prevalence, 
           y= life_expectancy )) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_smooth(method="gam") + 
  labs(title="Negative correlation between HIV prevalence and life expectancy",
       subtitle="HIV prevalence and life expectancy",
       x="HIV prevalence",
       y="Life expectancy") + 
  theme_classic() + 
  facet_wrap(~region, scales="free")

#cleaning data before calculating correlation coefficient
correlation_hiv_lifeexpectancy <- three_combined %>%
  filter (!is.na(hiv_prevalence & life_expectancy)) %>%
  select(hiv_prevalence, life_expectancy) %>% 
  cor()

correlation_hiv_lifeexpectancy
```

> Overall, HIV and life expectancy are negatively correlated (p=-0.531). For regions like Sub-Saharan Africa the relationship seems rather clear, for other regions like East Asia & Pacific it's less obvious. Thus, in order to confirm a direct causal effect, a deeper investigation is necessary and also other variables should be considered.

## Relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita

```{r, cache=TRUE}
#Plotting two graphs, one for all countries, one focusing on the different regions
ggplot(data = three_combined, aes(x = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,
                                  y= SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title="Better living standard and healthcare access leads to less children",
       subtitle="GDP per capita and fertility rate",
       x="GDP per capita",
       y="Fertility rate") + 
  theme_classic()

ggplot(data = three_combined, aes(x = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,
                                  y= SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm) + 
  labs(title="Better living standard and healthcare access leads to less children",
       subtitle="GDP per capita and fertility rate",
       x="GDP per capita",
       y="Fertility rate") + 
  theme_classic() + 
  facet_wrap(~region, scales="free")

#cleaning data before calculating correlation coefficient
correlation_fertility_gdp <- three_combined %>%
  filter (!is.na(NY.GDP.PCAP.KD & SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) %>%
  select(NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, SP.DYN.TFRT.IN) %>% 
  cor()

correlation_fertility_gdp


```

> Fertility rate and GDP per capita seem to be negatively correlated. Especially Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and Latin America & Caribbean are good examples for this relationship. Higher income might lead to better access to healthcare and contraceptives. This anaylsis is underlined by a correlation coefficient of -0.509

## Regions having the most observations with missing HIV data 

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#Filtering for 1979-2011 because hiv data is only available for this time frame and then calculating both absolute and relative value of missing hiv data
hiv_miss <- three_combined %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  filter(date>=1979) %>%
  filter(date<=2011)  %>%
   summarize(NA_hiv = sum(is.na(hiv_prevalence)),
             NA_percentage = round (NA_hiv/n(),
                                    digits = 4)) %>%
  arrange(desc(NA_hiv))

#Plot - absolute values
ggplot(data = hiv_miss, aes(x = reorder(region, NA_hiv),
                            y = NA_hiv)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=NA_hiv), 
            vjust=0.5,
            hjust=2,angle=0, 
            color="red", size=3) + 
  labs(title="Missing HIV prevalence observations",
       subtitle="Per region / absolute values", 
       y="Missing HIV data",x="") + 
  theme_economist_white()

#Plot - relative values
ggplot(data = hiv_miss, aes(x = reorder(region, NA_percentage),
                            y = NA_percentage)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=scales::percent(NA_percentage)),
            vjust=0.5,
            hjust=2,angle=0,
            color="red", size=3) + 
  labs(title="Missing HIV prevalence observations",
       subtitle="Per region / relative values",
       y="Missing HIV data",
       x="") + 
  theme_economist_white()
```

> Considering absolute values, Europe & Central Asia are leading with the most missing values overall. However, considering proportion, it's East Asia & Pacific which are leading. Using the second analysis might be more helpful because not all regions do have the same number of countries.

## Top 5 countries with the greatest/lowest decrease in mortality rate per region

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#Preparing data by filtering and untidying
improvement <- three_combined %>%
                select(c("country","region","date","SH.DYN.MORT")) %>% 
                filter(date== "1960"| date=="2016") %>%
                pivot_wider(names_from="date", values_from="SH.DYN.MORT")

colnames(improvement) = c("country","region","start","end")

mutate(change_over_years=(end-start)/start) %>% 
group_by(region) %>%
summarize(country,change_over_years) %>%
arrange(region,desc(change_over_years))

#top 5 per region
best_five <- impro_mortality %>%
            slice_min(order_by= change_over_years,n=5) %>%
            summarize(country,change_over_years)

  labs(title="Countries with the greatest decrease in mortality 1960-2016",
       subtitle="Top 5 countries per region ",
       y="Change in mortality rate between 1960 and 2016",
       x="") +
  geom_text(aes(label=scales::percent(change_over_years)),
            vjust=1,
            hjust=2,
            angle=0,
            color="black", size=2.5) 

#bottom 5 per region  
worst_five <- impro_mortality %>%
    slice_max(order_by= change_over_years,n=5) %>%
  summarize(country,change_over_years)

#Plotting
ggplot(worst_five,aes(x=reorder(country,change_over_years),
                      y=abs(change_over_years))) +

  coord_flip() + 
  facet_wrap(~region,scales="free") + 
  labs(title="Countries with the worst decrease in mortality 1960-2016",
       subtitle="Bottom 5 countries per region ",
       y="Change in mortality rate between 1960 and 2016",
       x="") +
  geom_text(aes(label=scales::percent(change_over_years)),
            vjust=1,
            hjust=2,
            angle=0,
            color="black", size=2.5) 
```

> It is important to mention that the study has various limits. First, many countries do not have data for the specific time frame leading to a potential fabrication of the data. A solution might have been to use the first and last available data points of each country, however, this would have greated another issue considering the fact of comparing different times frames in that case. Further, it is potentially not enough to compare only relative values. It is not a surprise that the most developed countries had the lowest margins of improvement considering their already high level at the beginning. 

## Relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#Plotting
ggplot(data = three_combined, aes(x = SE.PRM.NENR,
                                  y= SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm) + 
  labs(title="Better living standard and healthcare access leads to less children",
       subtitle="Primary school enrollment and fertility rate",
       x="Primary school enrollment",
       y="Fertility rate") + 
  theme_classic() + 
  facet_wrap(~region, scales="free")

#cleaning data before calculating correlation coefficient
correlation_primary_fertility <- three_combined %>%
  filter (!is.na(SE.PRM.NENR & SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) %>%
  select(SE.PRM.NENR, SP.DYN.TFRT.IN) %>% 
  cor()

correlation_primary_fertility

```

> Considering the correlation coefficient of -0.716, there seems to be a clear negative correlation between these two variables. This reflects the general opinion that besides a higher GDP especially education has a very strong impact on the fertility rate. Usually better education leads to less children in a society. This is perfectly visualized in the Sub-Saharan Africa graph or the South Asia graph.
