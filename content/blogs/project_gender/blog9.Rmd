# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.

In this assignment we analyse data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. 

Please find below variables we will be testing: 

* hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. 

* `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016 

* `sex`: Female - Male 

* `degree`: highest education level attained 


Lets look at the data first

```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))

glimpse(gss)
skim(gss)
```

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Who uses Instagram and Snapchat more - men or women?

```{r, insta snapchat, cache=TRUE}

#Creating new variables
social_usage <- gss %>%
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(snapchat == "Yes" & instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No", snapchat == "NA" & instagrm == "NA" ~ "NA" ))

#Calculating the proportions of Yes's and those who answered
share_yes <- social_usage %>% 
  count(snap_insta == "Yes") %>% 
  mutate(n/sum(n)*100)

share_yes_no <- social_usage %>%
  filter(snap_insta != "NA")

share_yes_no %>% 
  count(snap_insta == "Yes") %>% 
  mutate(n/sum(n)*100)

#Social media usage
social_stats <- social_usage %>%
  group_by(snap_insta) %>%
  count(snap_insta) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = snap_insta, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(proporation_yes = Yes/(Yes+No))

social_stats

#95% confidence interval
ci_share <- social_usage %>%
  group_by(sex, snap_insta) %>%
  count(snap_insta) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = snap_insta, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(mean = Yes/(Yes+No), se = sqrt(mean*(1-mean)/(Yes+No)), t_critical = qt(0.975, (Yes+No)-1), lower = mean - t_critical*se, upper = mean + t_critical*se)

ci_share

#Absolute number of men and women using social media
ci_gender <- social_usage %>%
  group_by(sex, snap_insta) %>%
  count(snap_insta)

ci_gender1 <- social_usage %>%
  group_by(sex, snap_insta) %>%
  count(snap_insta) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = snap_insta, values_from = n)

ci_gender1

```

## Twitter, by education level

Is Twitter usage related to education level?

```{r, twitter, cache=TRUE}

#Turning to Factor variable and non alphabetical
twitter_users <- gss %>%
  group_by(degree) %>%
  count(twitter)

level_order <- c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")

twitter_count <- gss %>% 
  group_by(degree) %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, levels = level_order))

#Creating new variable bachelor_graduate
twitter_edu <- twitter_count %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(degree == "Bachelor" | degree == "Graduate" ~ "Yes", degree == "High school" | degree == "Junior college" | degree == "Lt high school" ~ "No", degree == "NA" ~ "NA" ))

#Proportion of bachelor_graduate
twitter_data <- twitter_edu %>%
  group_by(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  count(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = twitter, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(twitter_yes = Yes/(Yes+No))

twitter_data_set <- twitter_edu %>%
  group_by(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes", twitter != "NA") %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(per_tw = count/sum(count))

twitter_data_set

#Confidence intervals with 95% of Yes and No, and summary
twitter_CI_yes <- twitter_edu %>%
  group_by(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  count(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = twitter, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(mean = Yes/(Yes+No), se = sqrt(mean*(1-mean)/(Yes+No)), t_critical = qt(0.975, (Yes+No)-1), lower = mean - t_critical*se, upper = mean + t_critical*se)

twitter_CI_no <- twitter_edu %>%
  group_by(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  count(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = twitter, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(mean = No/(Yes+No), se = sqrt(mean*(1-mean)/(Yes+No)), t_critical = qt(0.975, (Yes+No)-1), lower = mean - t_critical*se, upper = mean + t_critical*se)

twitter_CI_yes

twitter_CI_no

twitter_CI_summary <- twitter_data_set %>%
  summarise(count, per_tw, se = sqrt((per_tw*(1-per_tw)/sum(count))), t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), margin_of_error = t_critical * se, lower = per_tw - margin_of_error, higher = per_tw + margin_of_error) 

twitter_CI_summary

```

> The confidence intervals do not overlap as the lower bound of "No" is higher than the upper bound of "Yes".


## Email usage

How much time do we spend on our emails during the week?

```{r, email, cache=TRUE}

#Creating new variable
email_usage <- gss

email_usage[email_usage == "NA"] <- NA

email_visualize <- email_usage %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(emailmin = as.integer(emailmin),
         emailhr = as.integer(emailhr),
         email = emailmin + emailhr*60)

#Visualizing the distribution of new variable
ggplot(data = email_visualize, aes(x = email)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Distribution on time spent on email weekly", x = "Minutes per week", y = "") + theme_clean() + NULL

ggplot(data = email_visualize, aes(x = email)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Distribution on time spent on email weekly", x = "Minutes per week", y = "Number of people") + theme_clean() + NULL
                        
#95% CI bootstrap for mean time Americans spend on email weekly
library(infer)

email_95 <- email_visualize %>%
  specify(response = email) %>%
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate (stat = "mean")

email_95_ci <- email_95 %>%
    get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

email_95_ci %>%
  mutate(lower_ci = lower_ci/60, upper_ci = upper_ci/60)

#99% CI bootstrap for mean time Americans spend on email weekly
email_99 <- email_visualize %>%
  specify(response = email) %>%
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate (stat = "mean")

email_99_ci <- email_99 %>%
    get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = "percentile")

email_99_ci
```

> Considering several outliers it is better to use the median number as a measure of the typical amount American spend on their email weekly. The mean would be skewed to the right.

> A 99% interval would be wider than the 95% one because it includes more variables of the sample.
