# GDP components over time and among countries

## Components of GDP in Germany, India and United States

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}
#making the data into the long format, transforming GDP data into billions and renaming components
tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = 4:51,
                 names_to = "year",
                 values_to = "GDP") %>% 
    mutate(GDP=GDP/1e9, 
    IndicatorName = case_when(
    IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household_expenditure",
    IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government_expenditure",
    IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation" ~ "Gross_capital_formation",
    IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
    IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
    IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "Gross_Domestic_Product"))

#glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

# Selecting GDP components for 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
indicator_list = c("Gross_capital_formation", "Exports", "Government_expenditure", "Household_expenditure", "Imports")

```

Now lets filter the data for US, India and Germany and plot it to see trends in specific components over time in those 3 countries

```{r GDP_graphs, fig.width = 10}
#filtering out the data for chosen countries and GDP components
data_selected <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list & IndicatorName %in% indicator_list)

#plotting GDP components over time
ggplot(data_selected, aes(x = year, y = GDP, group = IndicatorName, color = IndicatorName)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "GDP Components over time", 
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD", 
       y = "Billions US$", 
       color = "Components of GDP") +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(5)) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("Exports",
                                  "Government expenditure",
                                  "Gross capital formation",
                                 "Household expenditure",
                                 "Imports")) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = "#f0f0f0"),
        strip.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size = 0.5, fill = "grey"),
        panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size=0.5, fill = NA),
        legend.key = element_rect(colour = "transparent", fill = "transparent"),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

## Calculation of GDP differences

Lets see what is the difference between given GDP and implied GDP number

```{r}
#Calculating difference between given and implied GDP
GDP_calc <- data_selected %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = GDP) %>% 
  group_by(year, Country) %>% 
  mutate(GDP_calculation = Household_expenditure + 
           Government_expenditure + 
           Gross_capital_formation + 
           Exports - 
           Imports) %>% 
  inner_join(tidy_GDP_data %>% filter(IndicatorName == "Gross_Domestic_Product"), by = c("Country", "year")) %>% 
   mutate(Difference = ((GDP_calculation - GDP) / GDP) * 100) 
 
#glimpse(GDP_calc)
 
#Calculating average percentage difference
GDP_avg_diff <- GDP_calc %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(avg_diff = AVERAGE(Difference))

glimpse(GDP_avg_diff)

```

The % difference between the GDP figure included in the dataframe and the GDP calculated from the components is on average 0.87%

## Proportion of GDP components

Now we want to look at components more closely to see what is the breakdown of GDP in our 3 countries

```{r GDP_graphs2, fig.width = 10}
#Calculating proportion of each component in the total GDP value
GDP_proportion <- data_selected %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = GDP) %>%
  mutate(Net_Exports = Exports - Imports) %>%
  select(Country:"Gross_capital_formation", Net_Exports) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = "Household_expenditure" :Net_Exports,
               names_to = "GDP_Component", 
               values_to = "Proportion") %>%
  group_by(Country, year) %>%
  mutate(Proportion = Proportion/sum(Proportion))

#Plotting GDP components over time
ggplot(GDP_proportion, aes(x = year, y = Proportion, group = GDP_Component, color = GDP_Component)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars", 
       y = "proportion", 
       caption = "Source: United Nations,https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads",
       color = "") +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales ::percent) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("Government expenditure",
                                 "Gross capital formation", 
                                 "Household expenditure",
                                 "Net Exports")) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = "#f0f0f0"),
        strip.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size = 0.5, fill = "grey80"),
        panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black", size=0.5, fill = NA),
        legend.key = element_rect(colour = "transparent", fill = "transparent"),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1,size = 8))
```

## Comment of the findings

> Germany is a mature economy and we do not observe significant movements in their GDP components. One exception could possibly be Net Exports which has increased sharply around the 2000s which coincides with Euro adoption allowing Germany to trade more easily. 

> India, as an emerging economy, has a much more volatile GDP trend. We see a significant drop in consumption and a corresponding increase in investment in the 2000s. It could be caused by the start of the offshoring trend where firms realised it is cheaper for them to outsource services to India, hence the increase in investment. It is possible that this has caused the relative contribution of household consumption to decrease.

> In the US we can see a steady growth of household expenditure component and a corresponding drop of the investment component. Around the financial crisis of 2008 we can see a spike in government spending and a drop in consumption with a more significant decrease in investment. This is a result of the banking crisis.
