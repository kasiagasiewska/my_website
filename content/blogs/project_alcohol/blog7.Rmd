# Analysis of movies - IMDB dataset

## Loading the data 

Lets look at our data and clean it first

```{r,load_movies}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skim(movies)

# Counting missing values in the data
anyNA(movies)

# Checking for duplicates
dupes <- movies %>%
  select(title, director, year, duration) %>%
  duplicated()

table(dupes)["TRUE"]

# Creating a cleaned dataset
movies_clean <- movies[!dupes,]

```

## Finding the number of movies by genre

The most popular genre is Comedy!

```{r, clean_up}

movies_clean %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE)

```

## Finding the return on budget by genre

Which genre of movies has the highest return of the budget used?

```{r, table73246}

movies_by_ratio <- movies_clean %>%
  group_by(genre)
summarise(movies_by_ratio, 
          mean_gross = mean(gross), 
          mean_budget = mean(budget), 
          return_on_budget = mean_gross/mean_budget) %>%
arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

```

## Finding the top 15 directors by gross earnings

Lets look at who earns the most

```{r, table87534}

movies_director <- movies_clean %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(total_gross = sum(gross, na.rm=TRUE), 
            mean_gross = mean(gross, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_gross = median(gross,na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_gross = sd(gross, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_gross))

top15_director <- head(movies_director,15)

top15_director

```

## Summary statistics of movie ratings by genre and plotting a histogram

```{r, graph562}

movies_ratings <- movies_clean %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_rating = median(rating, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_rating = max(rating, na.rm=TRUE), 
            min_rating = min(rating, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE))

movies_ratings

ggplot(movies, 
       aes(x = rating)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~ genre) +
  theme_economist_white()

```

## Does the number of FB likes influence gross earnings?

  - We want to examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. We will produce a scatterplot and discuss whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. 
  
```{r, graph123}
ggplot(movies_clean, 
       aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, 
          y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +  
  scale_x_log10()  + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  theme_economist_white() +
  NULL
```

## Comment on the findings

> We chose the Gross as the Y-variable and the Facebook Likes as the X-variable because we believed Gross to be the dependent variable and Facebook Likes the independent one. On average, the number of facebook likes seems to be a good predictor of how well a movie will fare in the box office, however, there are many data points which lie outside this observation and which prove that this isn't always the case.  


  - No we will produce a scatterplot and doscuss whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies_clean, 
       aes(x = budget, 
           y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +  
  scale_x_log10()  + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  theme_economist_white() +
  NULL
```

## Comment gross_budget

> The tendency seems to indicate that the bigger the budget, the higher the movie will gross. This is especially true for movies with high budgets as we see a concentration of datapoints at that level. Some dataponts indicate that it is not always the case as many movies fall outside this high budget - high gross correlation. However, the overarching sense is that budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.
  

```{r, gross_on_rating}
ggplot(movies_clean, 
       aes(x = rating,
           y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +  
  scale_x_log10()  + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  theme_economist_white() +
  NULL
```

## Comment Gross_IMDB

> According to the datapoints, IMDB ratings tend to be higher for movies which have grossed highly indicating that IMDB ratings could be a good predictor of how much a movie will make. In reality however, its much more complicated to determine if IMDB scores are high because a movie has grossed highly, in which case it isn't so much a correlation as a causality.
