<div id="omega-group-plc--pay-discrimination" class="section level1">
<h1>Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination</h1>
<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries should be conducted.</p>
<p>Our team carried out the analysis to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<p>From the hypothesis testing, we are more than 95% confident that the null hypothesis is untrue. A significant difference between the male and female executive salaries has been confirmed in 3 different ways: the hypothesis testing using t.test(), the plot of the null hypothesis distribution with a red line corresponding to the p-threshold (as we can visually observe the line is very far away from 0), and a p&lt;0.05. However, we cannot affirm that this significant difference is due to discrimination as there may be some other factors involved. Finding out the true causes of the salary gap requires further analyses.</p>

<p>From the data obtained using t.test(), the plot of the null distribution and the p value (which is less than 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis. Hence, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of men and women. This conclusion doesn’t endanger the previous one that indicated that salaries of men and women are significantly different. However, from the current analysis, we can say the salaries are not necessarily different due to factors such as gender discrimination, there can be other factors such as experience having an important effect on the salary gap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scatterplot displaying the relationship between salary and experience shows us that these two variables are positively correlated. Moreover, their relationship resemble a logarithmic function, meaning that the marginal effect of a year of experience is positive but decreases over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our previous hypothesis testing and the correlation matrix confirm that males have on average more experience and higher salaries than females at Omega. Moreover,the correlation between salary and experience is positive and significant for both genders (ρ females= 0.812, ρ males= 0.661, ρ both=0.803), validating that the salary gap between the two groups may not come from discrimination but mainly from the difference in experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the slight discrepancy in the correlation between salary and experience across genders is caused by the cluster at experience=0 : many females at Omega have no experience and start at different salaries, perhaps because they have different degrees or backgrounds. Since we have no data points for males at experience=0 , it generates a difference between ρ females and ρ males. It would have been interestin tog analyze further if the same would have happened to males with no experience.</p>
